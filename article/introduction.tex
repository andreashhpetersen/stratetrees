Motivate for discrete reinforcement learning ... (list tools that produce policies that are similar)

However, discrete reinforcement learning suffers from some issues with the policies. Even if it succeeds, the constructed policies might be too large for humans to interpret. This challenges their explainability (even if we can verify them) ...

In this paper we look at the problem of decreasing the size of the policies expressed as decision trees ...

Our contributions include: ...

The experiments show that: ...

The paper proceeds as follows. ...
