  abstract = {Decision tree learning is a popular classification technique most commonly used in machine learning applications. Recent work has shown that decision trees can be used to represent provably-correct controllers concisely. Compared to representations using lookup tables or binary decision diagrams, decision tree representations are smaller and more explainable. We present dtControl, an easily extensible tool offering a wide variety of algorithms for representing memoryless controllers as decision trees. We highlight that the trees produced by dtControl are often very concise with a single-digit number of decision nodes. This demo is based on our tool paper [1].},

  abstract = {Recent advances have shown how decision trees are apt data structures for concisely representing strategies (or controllers) satisfying various objectives. Moreover, they also make the strategy more explainable. The recent tool dtControl had provided pipelines with tools supporting strategy synthesis for hybrid systems, such as SCOTS and Uppaal Stratego. We present dtControl 2.0, a new version with several fundamentally novel features. Most importantly, the user can now provide domain knowledge to be exploited in the decision tree learning process and can also interactively steer the process based on the dynamically provided information. To this end, we also provide a graphical user interface. It allows for inspection and re-computation of parts of the result, suggesting as well as receiving advice on predicates, and visual simulation of the decision-making process. Besides, we interface model checkers of probabilistic systems, namely STORM and PRISM and provide dedicated support for categorical enumeration-type state variables. Consequently, the controllers are more explainable and smaller.},

  abstract = {Formal models of cyber-physical systems, such as priced timed Markov decision processes, require a state space with continuous and discrete components. The problem of controller synthesis for such systems then can be cast as finding optimal strategies for Markov decision processes over a Euclidean state space. We develop two different reinforcement learning strategies that tackle the problem of continuous state spaces via online partition refinement techniques. We provide theoretical insights into the convergence of partition refinement schemes. Our techniques are implemented in . Experimental results show the advantages of our new techniques over previous optimization algorithms of .},
