  abstract = {Decision tree learning is a popular classification technique most commonly used in machine learning applications. Recent work has shown that decision trees can be used to represent provably-correct controllers concisely. Compared to representations using lookup tables or binary decision diagrams, decision tree representations are smaller and more explainable. We present dtControl, an easily extensible tool offering a wide variety of algorithms for representing memoryless controllers as decision trees. We highlight that the trees produced by dtControl are often very concise with a single-digit number of decision nodes. This demo is based on our tool paper [1].},

  abstract = {Formal models of cyber-physical systems, such as priced timed Markov decision processes, require a state space with continuous and discrete components. The problem of controller synthesis for such systems then can be cast as finding optimal strategies for Markov decision processes over a Euclidean state space. We develop two different reinforcement learning strategies that tackle the problem of continuous state spaces via online partition refinement techniques. We provide theoretical insights into the convergence of partition refinement schemes. Our techniques are implemented in . Experimental results show the advantages of our new techniques over previous optimization algorithms of .},
