# Stratetrees --- UPPAAL Stratego strategies for Python

This package allows you to take your exported UPPAAL Stratego strategies
(`json`) and use them in a Python setting. The intended use case is to evaluate
the UPPAAL Stratego trained strategy on [Gymnasium][1] environments (see
example). This package provides an API that should be directly aligned with that
of [stable-baselines3][2].
